# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Saturday, June 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting to learn React. Uploaded my first 100 Days of Code Challenge!

**Thoughts:** My goal is to learn React and learn how to build React Native mobile applications. So far I just started with very simple React Code. I'm still trying to get used to the syntax and using JSX. It's very interesting tho! More to come!
