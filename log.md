# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Saturday, June 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting to learn React. Uploaded my first 100 Days of Code Challenge!

**Thoughts:** My goal is to learn React and learn how to build React Native mobile applications. So far I just started with very simple React Code. I'm still trying to get used to the syntax and using JSX. It's very interesting tho! More to come!

### Day 1: Sunday, July 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded and installed the React Native CLI. Created first React Native Project. Became more familiar with JSX. Learned how to import and export components.

**Thoughts:** Continuing with my goal to build a React Native project. Today was interesting because I strayed a little from the course but I feel like I learned a lot. In the course, they suggest we use a provided link to an API which has some data about albums by Taylor Swift. Not being a huge TS fan, I decided to create my own API service using a npm package called json-server. It allows me to create a db.json file with my own API data and loads it to localhost:3000 so I can make a GET request from my React Native App. Now I have that tool available in my back pocket! Pretty cool stuff!

### Day 2: Monday, July 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Learned about the differences between Functional Components vs Class based components
- Learned about AJAX requests to my API
- Learned about promises in ES6
- Visualized the time line of booting up my app and in which order it fetches and renders data
- Downloaded Axios to help with GET request to my API
- Discovered more about state and updating the state in my class component

**Thoughts:** Today was huge! Made significant leaps with my react native project. I feel like this was the perfect project for me to work on for the 100 Days of Coding challenge. I am solidifying the concepts I learned while taking the MEAN stack at Coding Dojo while challenging myself with enough new material. Excited for tomorrow's challenge!

### Day 3: Wednesday, July 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- - Only use state with class based components. Functional components do not have access to state.
- Using the map method to iterate through the array of album objects
- Learned when referencing javascript in JSX, use curly braces
- Learned how to utilize props to communicate from the parent component to the child component
- Passing components as props
- I learned A LOT about positioning of components and elements for mobile which include Flex-box.
- I learned about rendering images with React Native. (An image will not expand by default to fill the space around it
- I learned how to destructure information so that my code looks clean and easier to read.

**Thoughts:** Another big day! I feel like I'm learning so much so fast that I'm concerned if I'll be able to remember it all. I guess the best way to keep all of it fresh to keep building projects and using the tools I learn.

### Day 4: Thursday, July 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- I learned how to make my application scroll by importing and using ScrollView
- How to create button component and style it
- Making the button component have a UX response when clicked by fading the opacity
- How to make the button component reusable by utilizing props
- Producing an action when a button is pressed by the user using the prop onPress
- In order to produce that action, I needed to import the Linking library and use the built in method openURL to open the url provided by my Beatles API

**Thoughts:** I feel really good about completing this simple React Native project. Looking forward to using my skills and building another application very soon!

### Day 5: Saturday, July 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Outlined the challenges for this app
- Will need an input component to take user text
- Created a new app
- Created a src folder that will hold all of the components for the main app
- Deleted the original App.js file

**Thoughts:** After completing my first react native app, I feel like this second app will be slightly easier to create. There will be a few new challenges, however, such as using Firecode for the server/database and having that connect with the app. Also, I will need to figure out how to do validations in react native.

### Day 6: Sunday, July 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Made use of components from past projects
- Copied and pasted them into our current project
- Instead of having multiple import statements at the the top of the page, I used a trick to import and export multiple components in one line of code “export * from …”
- The only catch is you can’t export default at the bottom of a component, you have to export an object with a key and value
- Created a Firebase account
- Within Firebase, created a sign in method for my application

**Thoughts:** Learning how to reuse components is going to be VERY valuable in the future when creating more apps. It's a very efficient way to stay DRY. Getting to work with Firebase is also very interesting. I've worked with SQL and NoSQL databases before but I've never had a chance to work with a database that is completely online. Looking forward to completing more tomorrow!

### Day 7: Monday, July 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Worked through the algorithms and data structures in a freeCodeCamp online lesson

**Thoughts:** Decided to change it up a little today. Worked on a few easy algorithms and data structures in a freeCodeCamp lesson.
