# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Saturday, June 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting to learn React. Uploaded my first 100 Days of Code Challenge!

**Thoughts:** My goal is to learn React and learn how to build React Native mobile applications. So far I just started with very simple React Code. I'm still trying to get used to the syntax and using JSX. It's very interesting tho! More to come!

### Day 1: Sunday, July 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded and installed the React Native CLI. Created first React Native Project. Became more familiar with JSX. Learned how to import and export components.

**Thoughts:** Continuing with my goal to build a React Native project. Today was interesting because I strayed a little from the course but I feel like I learned a lot. In the course, they suggest we use a provided link to an API which has some data about albums by Taylor Swift. Not being a huge TS fan, I decided to create my own API service using a npm package called json-server. It allows me to create a db.json file with my own API data and loads it to localhost:3000 so I can make a GET request from my React Native App. Now I have that tool available in my back pocket! Pretty cool stuff!

### Day 2: Monday, July 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
- Learned about the differences between Functional Components vs Class based components
- Learned about AJAX requests to my API
- Learned about promises in ES6
- Visualized the time line of booting up my app and in which order it fetches and renders data
- Downloaded Axios to help with GET request to my API
- Discovered more about state and updating the state in my class component

**Thoughts:** Today was huge! Made significant leaps with my react native project. I feel like this was the perfect project for me to work on for the 100 Days of Coding challenge. I am solidifying the concepts I learned while taking the MEAN stack at Coding Dojo while challenging myself with enough new material. Excited for tomorrow's challenge!
